[Livesite](https://course-management-react-frontend.vercel.app/)

This is Doctor finder web application (Frontend) developed with lightweidght Next.js with TypeScript,showcasing my skills in frontend development and design with Tailwind Css and Shad-cn UI. The application converts two provided designs into fully functional web pages, closely adhering to the original designs and enhancing the user experience with smooth motion designs.

## Features

### Design Conversion
- **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**: Both designs have been meticulously translated into Next.js with Typescript.
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensures compatibility across devices, providing a seamless user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Animations**: Smooth motion designs have been incorporated to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.

### Functional Pages
- **Homepage**: Includes visually appealing sections and intuitive navigation, providing a comprehensive overview of the applicationâ€™s features and purpose.
- **Details Page**: Dynamically loads and displays detailed information about doctors, including their name, specialty, contact information, and availability.
- **Dynamic Data Integration**: Features a custom dataset of doctors, loaded dynamically to showcase real-world scenarios of data-driven UI elements.

### TypeScript Configuration and Type Checking
- **Strict TypeScript Setup**: Ensures robust type checking to prevent runtime errors and enhance code reliability.
- **Custom Types**: Defined and utilized custom TypeScript interfaces for better type safety and maintainability.
- **Type Checking**: All components and data interactions are validated through TypeScript, ensuring consistency and preventing common bugs.

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js with TypeScript**: For building the frontend components.
- **Typescript** (if applicable): To optimize code quality and dev performance.
- **Tailwind & Shad Cn UI**: For smooth experience and interactive effects.
